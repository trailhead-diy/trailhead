# Archive

This directory contains legacy documentation files that are no longer actively maintained but are preserved for historical reference.

## Archived Files

### PACKAGE_DOCUMENTATION_TEMPLATE.md

Legacy documentation template superseded by the Diátaxis-based templates in `/docs/reference/templates/`. The current templates provide better structure and separation of concerns.

### TEST_TEMPLATE.md

Legacy test documentation template replaced by the high-ROI testing approach documented in `/docs/testing-guide.md`. The new approach focuses on user interactions and business logic rather than implementation details.

## Migration Path

If you need to reference these files:

- For documentation templates: Use `/docs/reference/templates/`
- For testing guidance: See `/docs/testing-guide.md`
- For current standards: See `/docs/reference/documentation-standards.md`
