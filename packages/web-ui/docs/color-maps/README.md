# Color Maps

This directory contains detailed color mapping documentation for Catalyst UI components, showing how colors are used semantically within each component.

## Purpose

These documents help understand:
- What CSS custom properties each component uses
- How colors are applied in different variants (solid, outline, plain)
- Color variations across different color schemes
- Dark mode adaptations
- Interactive state colors (hover, active, focus, disabled)

## Structure

Each component document follows this pattern:
1. **Component Overview** - Brief description and available variants
2. **Base Styles** - Colors used in the base component styles
3. **Variant Styles** - Colors specific to each variant (solid, outline, plain)
4. **Color Table** - Comprehensive mapping of all color schemes
5. **CSS Custom Properties** - List of all CSS variables used

## Available Components

- [Button](./button.md) - Button component color mapping

## Usage

These mappings are essential for:
- Understanding the original Catalyst UI color system
- Creating semantic token mappings
- Theme customization
- Migration to Trailhead UI's semantic color system
